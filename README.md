# My-Portfolio
## Description

In this application I started a professional portfolio. This will be used to eventually have potential employers loook at my work and learn a little more about me. In building this application I learned how to start from zero with my HTML and CSS, linking my CSS style sheet to my index.html, and making a Github repository that included all my corresponding files and images. While building this portfolio and applied css styles like flexbox and media queries and learned how to use them to make a responsive website.

## Installation 
I had no starter code for this application. 

## Usage

This application will be displaiying my current work and futre projects that I will be working on. It provides and contact-me section where you can access my phone number, Github, email and twitter account. There is an about me section where you can learn a little more about me. This page will be available to future employers for further information about me.
